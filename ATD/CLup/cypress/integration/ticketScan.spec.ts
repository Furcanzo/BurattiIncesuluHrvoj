/*
* This function allows a store manager to scan (and validate) a customerâ€™s ticket
* (both at the entrance and the exit of the store).
* This has the double purpose of:
*     updating the data contained into the store overview,
*     and make sure that the flow of customers corresponds to that expected by the system (no one is able to enter before his turn).
