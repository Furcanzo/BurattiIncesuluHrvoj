/*
* This function is a fallback of the first one, indeed, it allows the store manager to insert into the queue any guest requesting it.
* The system will provide the store manager with a digital ticket,
*     which he will have to convert into physical (by printing it) and hand out to the guest.
* Finally, the guest is able to leave the queue at any time before entering the store,
*     by asking the store manager to delete his ticket.
