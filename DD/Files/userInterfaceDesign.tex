\subsection{User Interface Diagram}
The following diagram represents the flow of events that the user can choose to follow in order to obtain the service they're looking for.
From any window it's always possible to go back to the home window related to the role of the user, these arrows are not explicit in the diagram for a cleaner diagram.
The mockups of the application appearance are presented in the RASD document.
