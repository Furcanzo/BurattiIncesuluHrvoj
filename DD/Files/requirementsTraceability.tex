\subsection{Functional Requirements}
In this subsection each requirement specified in the RASD document is matched with the appropriate component's role on satisfying the requirement.
% Some requirements may involve integrations with external components, so those components are also included in the list.
The choice of the design elements has been made in order to guarantee the satisfaction of all the requirements, and, consequently the fulfillment of all the goals.
The components of the client application are not included in this list, as the client application acts as a view layer on top of the application logic in the server, and doesn't contain any significant application logic within itself.
