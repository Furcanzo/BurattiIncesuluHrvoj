\subsubsection{Description of the Proposed System}
The project CLup is a line spot reservation system that is planned to be used by managers and customers of many local vendors and chains.
The system aims to provide assistance to cope with the customer load for managers and to help customers access to products in a safe and controlled manner.

\subsubsection{Goals}

General Purpose:
      “CLup - Customer Line up” aims to come up with a handy solution for the ongoing issue of proper social distancing management particularly in the matter of grocery shopping. By providing an easy to use and powerful solution, “CLup” seeks for the convenience of both - customers as well as the shop managers. In particular, users will be able to see the locations, get a line number and book in advance for the grocery stores they would like to visit. Once assigned a line number, the customer will be able to track the estimated time of arrival of the line as well as will wait for the notification that informs about his or her line’s forthcoming arrival, hence the time spent at the outside for the waiting in the line among the crowd is kept at minimum. Also, on the other side, “CLup” provides uniquely generated QR codes per the line number, which can be utilized by the store managers as a proper monitoring tool in the entrances of the shops. All in all, the general purpose of the product is to keep the human congestion levels in the lines of the shops at the minimum via providing useful features for all the actors.
