\subsection{Purpose}
% here we include the goals of the project

\subsubsection{Description of the Proposed System}
The project CLup is a line spot reservation system that is planned to be used by managers and customers of many local vendors and chains.
The system aims to provide assistance to cope with the customer load for managers and to help customers access to products in a safe and controlled manner.

% TODO: This needs expansion @Aydin
\subsubsection{Goals}
% Manager:
% Set the estimated customer number to be in the location (based on govt. regulations, space availability etc.)
% Set the opening and closing hours of the store per day.
% REALLY ?!?!?!??!: availability and location info on different products?
% Set the in-shop location & categories of products in the location
% Set the limit of reservation per customer per month, per day, per week
% Set the location of the store
% Add other chain members or partner stores
% Monitor the entrance and exit of customers with their line numbers, using QR codes.
% Observe the current amount of customers in the location.
% Stop the system from issuing more tickets for a given day in case of an overflow or emergency
% Print line numbers with QR code on them for the physically arriving customers who doesn't have a virtual ticket
% Enter manually the line number, customer info to open gates
% Set the timeout


% User:
% Retrieve a direct line number for a location
% Generate a QR code for entry
% See an ETA, like 30 mins are left for your line number
% View the location of the store to plan their trip
% Book a future line number for a day
% See the occupancy of the location for different time and day.
% View the alternative slot suggestions for the visit planned
% View the alternative slots available in near chain or partner stores
% Set the categories, products of interest before visit for finer granularity.
% Set the estimated time for visit.
% See the amount of people currently in the store
% Set user details, name, surname
% View forecasted occupancy for time slots.

% System:
% Forecast the occupancy of store per time slot
% Opens the doors when QR code is scanned upon entry and exit
% Timeouts the line numbers when not registered for given timeout by manager.

% TODO: Write goals accordingly @Aydin

\subsection{Scope}

\subsubsection{Targeted Users}

CLup aims to resolve the problem of Customers queueing up in front of a location, without any control over the availability of place in the location and further contact tracing by the managers.
\\[0.5cm]
\textbf{Customer:} \\

Customers will be able to obtain specific line numbers for various locations using CLup, which they can track the estimated time available with and also view the location on a map application to plan their visit.
Customers can further obtain line numbers for future visits, based on the info provided by the system about the availability of free spots on the specific time intervals.
They may prefer to visit a different branch of the same chain.
Furthermore, they can provide specific products they intend to purchase or set an estimated time for their visit to allow finer granularity.
Some customers may also prefer to obtain a line number upon visiting the store physically.
To plan their visit in a time slot where the location will be less crowded, the users can see the occupancy of the location based on already taken line numbers and forecasts provided by the system.
\\[0.5cm]
\textbf{Manager:} \\

The location manager (which could be an actual manager, or someone responsible for handling customer management) can provide details regarding the availability of products and the location in general, by setting the opening hours, maximum allowed customers in shop, in-shop location of different products and categories, maximum amount of reservations that can be made per customer, line number timeout and the location.
Furthermore, the manager can monitor the flow of customers and manually intervene in case of missing line numbers via performing manual checkout for a specific customer, or by printing line numbers physically for some customers.
Also, for chains and relevant stores, the manager can add chain members for the location.

        The external interfaces that the system requires to function correctly is presented with details and additional mockups if needed.
        The interfaces section is mainly concentrated on different views of user interfaces as the user-facing part is the main way to integrate with the system.
        In this section, functional requirements of the system are presented in detail, a common use case diagram is provided, and each use-case of the system is analyzed with details on a use case description table and a sequence diagram.
        The performance requirements of the system, with a focus on %TODO add when performance requirements are written
        The design constraints of the system, with a focus on different standard compliances, hardware limitations of the system to function and other constraints, like GDPR are also elaborated on this section.
