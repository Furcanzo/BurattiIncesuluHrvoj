\subsection{Purpose}
% here we include the goals of the project

\subsubsection{Description of the Proposed System}
The project CLup is a line spot reservation system that is planned to be used by managers and customers of many local vendors and chains.
The system aims to provide assistance to cope with the customer load for managers and to help customers access to products in a safe and controlled manner.

% TODO: This needs expansion @Aydin
\subsubsection{Goals}
% Manager:
% Set the estimated customer number to be in the location (based on govt. regulations, space availability etc.)
% Set the opening and closing hours of the store per day.
% REALLY ?!?!?!??!: availability and location info on different products?
% Set the in-shop location & categories of products in the location
% Set the limit of reservation per customer per month, per day, per week
% Set the location of the store
% Add other chain members or partner stores
% Monitor the entrance and exit of customers with their line numbers, using QR codes.
% Observe the current amount of customers in the location.
% Stop the system from issuing more tickets for a given day in case of an overflow or emergency
% Print line numbers with QR code on them for the physically arriving customers who doesn't have a virtual ticket
% Enter manually the line number, customer info to open gates
% Set the timeout


% User:
% Retrieve a direct line number for a location
% Generate a QR code for entry
% See an ETA, like 30 mins are left for your line number
% View the location of the store to plan their trip
% Book a future line number for a day
% See the occupancy of the location for different time and day.
% View the alternative slot suggestions for the visit planned
% View the alternative slots available in near chain or partner stores
% Set the categories, products of interest before visit for finer granularity.
% Set the estimated time for visit.
% See the amount of people currently in the store
% Set user details, name, surname
% View forecasted occupancy for time slots.

% System:
% Forecast the occupancy of store per time slot
% Opens the doors when QR code is scanned upon entry and exit
% Timeouts the line numbers when not registered for given timeout by manager.

% TODO: Write goals accordingly @Aydin
