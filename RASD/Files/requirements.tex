% Here we include more details on all aspects in Section 2 if they can be useful for the development team.

\subsection{External Interface Requirements}

\subsubsection{User Interfaces}

% We need a tool, either stores raw content as text in our repo, or integrates with GitHub.
% TODO: Find the tool , maybe moqups? @Aydin

% Actual mockups of user interfaces

\subsubsection{Hardware Interfaces}

% Do we integrate with external hardware? Like the entrance door?
\subsubsection{Software Interfaces}

% Do we integrate with custom software, expose an API?

\subsubsection{Communication Interfaces}


% What is a communication interface? the Internet? RF port? Radio? Bluetooth?

\subsection{Functional Requirements}
% Use draw.io, compatible with GitHub.


% TODO: @Roberto start
% Definition  of  use  case  diagrams,  use  cases  and  associated sequence/activity diagrams, and mapping on requirements

% Use case diagram

% For each use case:
%   Use case table
%   Use case sequence diagram


% Goals, mapped to the requirements and domain assumptions they relate to
% (Requirements are defined in Overview -> Product functions)
% (Domain assumptions are in Overview -> Assumptions,dependencies and constraints -> Domain Assumptions)
\subsection{Performance Requirements}

% Some basic stuff about how much users the system takes, speed etc...


\subsection{Design Constraints}

\subsubsection{Standards compliance}
% QR standard, UTC timing standard, GPS, etc...

\subsubsection{Hardware limitations}
% What needs to be on the phone?
\subsubsection{Any other constraint}
% GDPR regulations, local laws, etc...

% Isn't this similar to Overview -> Assumptions,dependencies and constraints -> Constraints?

\subsection{Software System Attributes}

\subsubsection{Reliability}

% Don't crash for long time, fault tolerance strategies like RAID, backups, etc

\subsubsection{Availability}

% 99.5% availability minimum, release any hardware control in case of power cut or unavailability.

\subsubsection{Security}

% Data hashing, salting, encryption of user data if necessary.

\subsubsection{Maintainability}

% Testing practices on all levels

\subsubsection{Portability}

% Usage of widely adopted platforms (Java, .NET, Browser), no custom protocol implementation apart from wide-spread
