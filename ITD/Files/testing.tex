\subsubsection{Unit Testing}
A unit test case is a part of code designed mainly for testing, which ensures that another part of code works as expected.
To get the desired results quickly, a test framework was required. JUnit is a perfect unit test framework for the Java programming language.
A formal written unit test case is characterized by a known input and an expected output, which is worked out before the test is executed.
The known input should test a precondition and the expected output should test a post-condition.
There are at least two unit test cases for each requirement $-$ one positive test and one negative test.
If a requirement contains sub-requirements, each sub-requirement has at least two test cases as positive and negative.
Automatic Junit tests have been proven to be more efficient than the manual testing process.
Junit tests have been created with the help of the Java Unit Test Generator for IntelliJ IDEA in order to speed up the testing process.
