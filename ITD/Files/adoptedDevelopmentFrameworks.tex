\subsection{Programming languages}

Java language has been used for the backend implementation.
One of the main reasons to use Java was it being platform independent and it being mainly object oriented.
We have decided that Java is good for building web application such as CLup, given that it provides common interfaces like JPA with minimal configuration necessary.

\subsection{Frameworks}

We used the Java Spring framework because it offers a lot of modules that can help with the implementation.
One of those is Spring Web that offers annotations for exposing rest endpoints, as well as Spring Data
that offers the JPA repositories which are used to handle the JPA mapping.

For the frontend part, we have used Bootstrap framework to have a basic set of widgets to build our application.
Also, we have used Hyperapp tooling to perform state management on the whole app.
\subsection{Additional APIs}

Google Maps API has been used in order to set the store location.
Instasan library is used to automatically retrieve QR codes from scanned input streams.
