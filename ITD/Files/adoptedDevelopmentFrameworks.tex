\subsection{Programming languages}

Java language has been used for the backend implementation.
One of the main reasons to use Java was because of its platform independencies and its object-oriented approch.
We have decided that Java is good for building web application such as CLup.

\subsection{Frameworks}

We used the Java Spring framework because it offers a lot of modules that can help with the implementation.
One of those is Spring Web that offers annotations for exposing rest endpoints, as well as Spring Data
that offers the JPA repositories which are used to handle the JPA mapping.

For the frontend part, we have used Bootstrap framework to create fully responsive web application.

\subsection{Additional APIs}

Google Maps API has been used in order to set the store location.
