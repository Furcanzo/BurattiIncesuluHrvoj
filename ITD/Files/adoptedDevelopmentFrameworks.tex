\subsection{Programming languages}

Java language has been used for the implementation.
One of the main reasons to use Java was because of its platform independencies and its object-oriented approch.
We have decided that Java is a good for building web application such as CLup.

\subsection{Frameworks}

We used the Java Spring framework because it offers a lot of modules that help with implementation.
One of those is Spring Web that offers annotations for exposing rest endpoints, as well as Spring Data
that offers the JPA repositories which are used to handle the JPA mapping.

Bootstrap has been used to create fully responsive user interface.
